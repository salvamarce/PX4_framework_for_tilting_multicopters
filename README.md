## A PX4 Integrated Framework for Modeling and Controlling Multicopters with Tiltable Rotors

__abstract__ This repo presents a general framework for multicopters equipped with tiltable rotors (tilting multicopters). Differently from classical flat multicopters, tilting multicopters can be fully actuated systems able to decouple position and attitude control. The proposed framework has been trans-parently integrated into the widely used PX4 control stack, an open-source controller for ground and aerial systems, to fully exploit its high-level interfaces and functionalities and, at the same time, simplify the creation of new devices with tilting propellers. Simulation tools have been also added to the PX4 simulation framework, based on its Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) system and a set of simulated experiments in a dynamic robotic simulator have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of this system.
